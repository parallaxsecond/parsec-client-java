# Parsec Java Client

This repository contains a Java Client and a [JCA provider](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html) for Parsec. The client exposes the [PSA Crypto API](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-crypto/blob/psa-crypto-api/docs/PSA_Cryptography_API_Specification.pdf) to Java Applications and the JCA Provider allows existing applications that employ JCA to switch to Parsec.

_Note_: this client is at an early stage of development and not yet ready for production use. We welcome contributions!

## In this repository

The repository contains the following packages:

- parsec-client-java : PSA Crypto API Client
- parsec-jca-java: JCA Provider
- parsec-interface-java: Private wrapper for protobuf classes and socket communication
- parsec-protobuf-java: Java Protobuf classes (generated)
- parsec-testcontainers: Collection of Docker test containers for development & testing

# How to use this library

TODO

# How to develop the Parsec Java Client

Check out this repo's submodules:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

You can use `act` to run the github action locally. On OSX, you need to set the container architecture, and for testcontainers to work, you may need to set the env var `TESTCONTAINERS_HOST_OVERRIDE`.

Example CLI input:

```sh
act --container-architecture linux/amd64 --env TESTCONTAINERS_HOST_OVERRIDE=`ipconfig getifaddr en0`
```

# Example Implementations

There are a number of example implementations of both the basic java client and JCA provider along with a demo (separate repository)
Both the tests and workshop demo cover the basic functionality of the current implementation:

- Parsec JCA Tests [**Link**](/parsec-jca-test)
- Parsec Test Containers [**Link**](/parsec-testcontainers)
- Parsec Workshop Demos (External Repository) [**Link**](https://github.com/56kcloud/parsec-workshop)
